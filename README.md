# Graphical Passwords to Prevent Shoulder Surfing

An application with user profiles and secure authentication used a prototype to show the usage of a graphical dial as a password. This prevents shoulder surfing by making sure that a person seeing you enter the password using a dial does not know the colour you chose, and hence the text that you used for your password.
Shuffling of the colours on the dial is used in order to better the security.
